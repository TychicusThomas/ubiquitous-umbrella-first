//Notes from the class demo

//Made a UNA faculty knowledge base with all CRUD ops Can deploy in-house infrastructure at home using dynamic DNS Static IP - IP assigned to your company permanently while contract lasts No-ip(website) - used for dynamic IP Dynamic IP changes on an interval Reverse proxy self domain - subdomain networking thing (tbc) Companies try to deploy their backend externally to a trusted third party Hackers target backend rather than frontend, since more data is present Bad weather is bad for hosting in-house servers External infrastructure using cloud Use cloudry - $1.50 a month, enough cloud infrastructure to host an app. Returns a static, public IP Puts liability onto the host company instead Learn about the system
*Rooted in from the campus computer into his own server to show applications *React/angular *Company doesn’t focus to much on front end in order to save cost *firebase almost like render front end for the application Problem with hosting server with bad weather server can be destroyed. Uses his own servers for his work and projects {Cloudzy- cheaper than Google cloud and azure. “15 a month round a bout strong server to host app to show employers” Returns a static and public

//" why did I add the I.P??? who knows keep pushing ty. 

I.p IPV4 45.61.158.107 IPV6 2604:7980:0:21a2::1 Look back at later for better understanding different ip’s Provides everything for low prices and can use GitHub desktop Mongo fb on Linux install commands Looks like returns back a window server? Namecheap : regrister domain cheaper than usual and gives back an active account. Some mongo Some node Different deployment systems used different services to save himself money Utilizes GitHub and mongosh and such even after graduating four years later. Svelt instead of ejs Fast api

the concept or tech I personally feel as though I would like to learn more about is his concept of saving money in order to host his own servers. I can fully say thst I have had the mindset thatv "hey I work for this company they are gonna pay for everything!". that has been proven wrong... The concept I want to learn more about would be the concept of being efficient and proffesional but saving money! in todays day and age things are not cheap, this isnt a opinion everyone is going through this. One thing I would love to learn is hey if I am going to be doing these things at home on my dime how can I do so and save money... But be effective and efficient at the same time as I am doing so. A program I am looking more deeply into is the cloudzy program. through different programs at UNA I have used Azuew and Google Cloud. But I want to research the cheaper option and see if it could even be seen as better for the same type of job. so in short I would focus on cloudzy. Cloudzy is a cloud-based hosting provider that specializes in VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting. It is designed for businesses and individuals seeking high-performance, flexible, and cost-efficient hosting solutions. Here’s an overview of what Cloudzy offers, why it is used, and how to use it:
Cloudzy provides Cloud VPS hosting that leverages the power of cloud infrastructure, offering scalability, reliability, and high performance. These servers run on powerful hardware (e.g., AMD EPYC processors, NVMe SSD storage, and DDR4 RAM) for fast and efficient computing. Cloudzy also ensures 99.95% uptime and DDoS protection, making it suitable for a wide range of uses, from hosting websites to running machine learning models or game serversCloudzy is popular for several reasons: Scalability: You can scale your resources (CPU, RAM, storage) as your needs grow or shrink.Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG): You only pay for the resources you use, making it a cost-effective option, especially for small businesses or personal projects.
Versatility: Whether you're running a website, trading in the Forex market, hosting a game server, or developing machine learning applications, Cloudzy provides a suitable hosting environment. Global Availability: Cloudzy has servers in over 15 global locations, allowing users to pick a server location that minimizes latency for their users.
The most closely related to the app that we are using would be Github surpirse surprise.... But I am not all that shocked considering how much we utilize this in different classes and our own Dr.Cumbie also uses this as he has stated for different projects no matter if that us for a personal or profeesional project. 

two questions I would have woyld be why did you pick cloudzy out of any other platform you could have found and are you happy with the services so far or are you looking for a different service to use currently. and also when you aka the speaker where a student learning here did you have trouble learning this and feel as though you would never be able to do this in the real world? or did it come easy to you and you knew this was the path you wanted to take from the begining.
